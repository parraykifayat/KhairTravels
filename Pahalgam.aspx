                <p>
                     Pahalgam, a hill station perched high in the Himalayas at 2740 meters above sea level, is a dreamy location. It is 92 kilometers from Srinagar, and is located along the banks of the Lidder River. The Valley of Shepherds is located at the confluence of the Aru Valley and the Sheshnag River, and is surrounded by the Himalayan Range Mountains.

                    This spectacular grandeur, surrounded by beautiful green meadows, snow-capped mountains, scenic valleys, and gushing rivers, has drawn travelers, trekkers, sport-lovers, and thrill-seekers alike. Pahalgam is so beautiful that even Bollywood is enamored with it. It has long been a popular site for filming films ranging from Betaab (1983) to Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015).

              <h3>History</h3>
                 <p>
                     As per Archaeological evidence, the earliest human habitation in the region from the Neolithic Age was found at Burzahom in Srinagar, Bomai, and Pahalgam.
                     The 'Valley of Shepherds,' as it is known locally, implies that nomadic shepherds have used the abundant pastures to feed their flock of sheep for ages. Hindu pilgrims have historically used the location as a transit route and rest stop on their sacred trip to Amarnath Caves. This ancient custom was first mentioned in Kalhana's 'Rajatrangini,' which was written in 1148.
                     The most well-known account of Pahalgam's documentation dates from the Mughal dynasty. Francois Bernier's Ain-e-Akbari provides a detailed account of the Mughal administration. Therein is also mentioned the place en route to Amarnath Caves, Pahalgam.

                 <h3>Go for the Adventure of River Rafting</h3>
                 <p>
                     River Rafting is usually done on the gushing water of the Lidder River from April to September. Depending on the levels, sports lovers have three options to choose from:<br />
                     Lidder joy ride - a 2.5 km ride.<br />
                     Lidder long ride - a 5 km ride.<br />
                     An extra-long ride - up to 8 km.<br />
                     Each course has rapids ranging from grade II to III and IV, respectively.<br />
                     The rafting runs for 8 kilometers, from Langanbal Bridge to Ganeshpura, and takes around 45 minutes to complete. The next leg of the journey takes you all the way downriver. Rafting is done by a variety of organizations. The most difficult rafting experience, however, may be found on the Zanskar River, which runs through gorges between the Zanskar Mountains and Padum and Nimu in Ladakh region.

                  Amarnath Cave
              </h3>
              <p>
                  At an elevation of 12,756 feet above sea level, Amarnath cave is a holy shrine on Mount Amarnath's peak. Amarnath is the holiest shrine of Lord Shiva and one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus, built over a 5000-year-old cave. These caves are about 68 kilometers from Srinagar's capital city and may be reached via Pahalgam.
                  <br />
                 Inside the mountain cave, water droplets drip down from the top and freeze into ice, forming an ice stalagmite known as Shiv Linga, which Hindus believe is a phallic emblem of Hindu God Lord Shiva. Shiv Linga's natural ice formation grows from May to August and then gradually wanes after that.<br />

                 Mamleshwara Temple
              </h3>
              <p>
                    Mamleshwara Temple is a famous Shiva temple located on the banks of the icy Kolahoi River. This single-structured temple, located 2 kilometers from Pahalgam, is entirely made of stone and depicts the heyday of Hindu monarchs. The grandeur of ancient craftsmanship is displayed in temple archaeology. The Rajatrangini recalls King Jayasimha's (1128-1155 AD) redecorating of the temple, which included a gilded finial.

                    The temple is an important religious site that draws pilgrims from all over the world. It is said that the courtyard's spring is the same where Goddess Parvati used to take a bath and directed his son Ganesha to prohibit anyone's entry while she was inside. Shiva was enraged when Ganesha denied him admission while guarding the entrance. Shiva decapitated Ganesha in rage. Lord Shiva afterward restored his life at Goddess Parvati's request..</p>

                 Sheshnag Lake
              </h3>
              <p>The history of Sheshnag Lake may be traced back to the sacred pilgrimage of Amarnath. Lord Shiva abandoned the Sheshnag decorating his neck on his trip to Amarnath Caves to teach the secret of immortality to his beloved Parvati. After abandoning Nandi (bull) and the Chandra (crescent moon), he left Sheshnag (king of the snakes) here for complete seclusion.
                  <br />

                    Sheshnag Lake is the ideal of natural beauty and calm, and it is one of Pahalgam's primary attractions. This green-colored lake, surrounded by snow-capped mountains, is home to a variety of species, including brown trout. This lake's water is deemed to be of high quality because it has a low level of algae production.

                Arriving here, at a height of 3,353 meters above sea level, is a difficult effort due to the long trip and steep hills. The lake frequently looks to have ice chunks floating in it</p>
