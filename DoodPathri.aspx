                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>There was once a famous Kashmiri saint Sheikh Noor din Noorani who had come to this place to pray. He wanted to pray and was looking for water in the meadows. He used his stick to prick the ground in search of water. And instead of water, milk comes gushing out. Sheikh Noorani, however, did not want to use the milk to wash his hands and feet. He thought that the milk was to be used for drinking purposes only. So by divine provenance, the milk again changed back to water! And the meadows got its name “Doodhpathri”.

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>Doodhpathri is a piece of heaven on earth. This bowl-shaped valley in Kashmir is located at an altitude of 8957 feet. Very few people visit this place. Most of the tourists visiting Kashmir usually travel to Gulmarg and Sonmarg on their first visit. Not many tourists visit here. Majority of the people visiting there are mostly Kashmiri locals going there for picnics. However, you can include this place in your itinerary if you want to explore a bit of offbeat Kashmir.
