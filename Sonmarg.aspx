                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Sonamarg is tucked away from the mainland, about a two-and-a-half-hour drive from Srinagar. Serenely located at an altitude of 2740 m, the magic of Sonamarg is heightened even further with the thrilling experience it offers.
                    It is known for trekking and hiking paths that lead to the eccentric lakes of Gadsar, Krishnasar, Gangabal, and Vishansar, which are surrounded by the massive Himalayas. The 4 mile walk to the Thajiwas range is the most popular. Sonamarg is divided into two parts by the Thajiwas range. On one side, there's the forest-covered Thajwas spur, which smells like fir and pine. On the other, there's Sonamarg.
                    The sun-drenched valley is crisscrossed by rivers teeming with Trout and Mahseer, making it a paradise for fishing. These rivers are ideal for white-water rafting because of their rapidity. During the winter, the enchantment occurs when the sun's rays strike the snow-covered alps and glaciers, converting the white caps into golden.

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                  Sonamarg is an important historical landmark in the Indian subcontinent's history. Sonamarg and its surrounding regions were once part of the ancient Silk Route, a vital trade route in medieval times, according to ancient historical records. In the past, this Silk Route provided a link between China and Tibet via Gilgit.
                  The picturesque valley near Zoji La Pass is one of the earliest significant roads connecting Srinagar and Leh. Sonamarg has played an important role in ancient trade and economics.
                  In terms of political history, King Pravarasena II, who governed Sonamarg 2000 years ago, is the earliest known ruler. Following him, the monarchs who ruled it alternated between Mauryas, Kushanas, Huns, Chaks, Mughals, and Sikhs.
                  During the colonization of South Asia, it was ruled by the British. Sonamarg, along with other parts of Kashmir, was given to Gulab Singh, the Dogra monarch, under a contract. It was ruled by the Dogras until 1947.

              <h3>Take one heck of a trek</h3>
              <p>
                  Nestled in lofty mountains and Himalayan wilderness is a 69 km long trek, known as 'Kashmir Great Lakes treks.' This name is no misnomer, as it is one of the most amazing treks in Kashmir and the globe.
                  Because of its grandeur and larger-than-life aspect, this is the only Himalayan journey that includes all three high altitude passes, five river basins, and seven alpine lakes, each with an amazing hue of green, blue, and turquoise.
                  The walk can take anywhere from four to six days, but each day offers a 360-degree view of untamed, craggy mountains, undulating meadows, and celestial-colored high-altitude lakes. The Great Lakes Treks in Kashmir should be on everyone's bucket list.
                  Switch between ascents and descents to reach wide valleys where horses and sheep graze casually and wildflowers peak from every corner as you walk under the canopy of maple and pine trees, roll-off mountain passes and meadows that seem like an oasis, switch between ascents and descents to reach wide valleys where horses and sheep graze casually and wildflowers peak from every corner.

                 <h3>Fish in the swishing waters</h3>
                 <p>
                     Sonamarg, a treasure trove of magical lakes, is the preferred spot among fishing and angling enthusiasts. Fly-fishing is particularly popular on the Indus River (also known as Sindh River), Krishnasar Lake, and Vishansar Lake.
                     Because the water bodies of Sonamarg are oxygen-rich, they are home to a diverse range of brown trout, snow trout, rainbow trout, Mahseer, and other fish. Trout and Mahseer schools can be found in the water bodies.
                     Although you can fish without permission in many places, you must acquire permission in others. The Directorate of Fisheries in Srinagar issues permits that allow for this for a maximum of three days. You can also rent equipment from this location. It's worth noting that the fishing season in Sonamarg runs from April to September.

                  Kheer Bhawani, Ksheer Bhawani or the Ragnya Devi temple is a Hindu temple situated at a distance of 25 kilometres north-east of
                  Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India, in the village of Tulmul in Ganderbal. It is dedicated to the Hindu goddess Kheer Bhavani constructed over a sacred spring

              <h3> Thajiwas Glacier</h3>
              <p>
                  The Thajiwas Glacier is a breathtaking natural phenomenon located just 3 kilometers from Sonamarg's main town. Sonamarg's showstopper is this glacier, which stands tall at 3000 meters. The dazzling silver glacier set against emerald fields and enormous bright blue skies is a must-see for all travelers.
                  To get to the glacier, one can either trek or hire a pony. However, one does not trek all the way to the summit merely to see the glacier; instead, one treks to see 'SnowPoint.' Along the route, you will be enchanted by the various waterfalls, alpine meadows, and a gleaming silver frozen lake in the heart of the greenscape.
                  The entire scenario seems like something out of a dream film. It's no surprise that it's been featured in Bollywood films. Riding a sled for a fun trip, walking beneath the canopy of fir and pine trees, camping against the backdrop of towering hills, escaping the blistering heat of summers in cooling highland air, and restoring your tranquility while resting alongside streams near the glacier are all options.
                  Visit the glacier, which is snow-covered throughout the year. Still, it's best to

              <h3>Baltal Valley</h3>
              <p>
                  Baltal is a magnificent valley located at the foot of Zoji La, along the banks of Sindh's cheerfully running river. The scenic valley, located 15 kilometers from Sonamarg, is vital because it gives a shorter route to the famous Amarnath Cave.
                  It serves as the pilgrims' main camping place and serves as a base for the Amarnath Yatra. Specks of dazzling colorful tents pitched among green leafage provide a riot of colors as far as the eye can see. The shrine board looks after the area, which includes tents, temporary bathrooms, food kiosks, and langars to make pilgrims' stay more comfortable.

              <p>
                  Gadsar Lake, located approximately 28 kilometers from Sonamarg at a height of 5000 meters above sea level, is one of Kashmir's highest lakes. It is part of the famous Great Lakes Trek. In the summer, the lake's verdant pastures are adorned with brightly colored exotic wildflower blooms, naming the region the "Valley of Flowers 2."
                  The lake becomes a frozen paradise in the winter when it is coated in a crystalline sheet of ice. The icebergs drifting in the lake add to the beauty of the scene. The lake's bluish-green waters are so clean that the cloud rings, huge mountains, and all the natural splendor that surrounds it cast a mirror-like reflection, adding to the grandeur of the sight.
                  It receives its name from Gadsar, which means 'the lake of fishes' in the local tongue. Interestingly, the lake is also known as 'Yamsar Lake,' where 'Yam' relates to the Hindu god of death 'Yama.'

                <p>
                    Nichinai pass, at an elevation of 4139 meters, is a high mountain pass. Tourists flock to the site, which is 13 kilometers from Sonamarg and has something to offer everyone. Nichinai Pass, which serves as the major base for the trekking circuit in Sonamarg, is the main route to several of the hill station's viewing spots, particularly Krishnasar and Vishansar Lake. It has various hiking trails, plenty of space for setting up camp, and, most all, commanding spectacular views of low-lying areas.
