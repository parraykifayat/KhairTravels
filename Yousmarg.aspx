                 <h3>Background</h3>
                 <p>
                     Yousmarg is a classic undiscovered natural song, surrounded by silver white pyramid peaks, virgin meadows, forests, and rushing waterfalls. Long stretches of grasslands flanked by deodar, pine, and Chinar trees can be found here.
                     Yousmarg, 50 kilometers from Srinagar, is known for its unrivaled beauty, which has been unaffected by pollution and population growth. As a result, it has retained its original allure, exuding tranquility and serenity. It's a fantastic place for postcard-perfect shots because there's less foot traffic here. It is home to the tallest peaks in the Pir Panjal range, including the Tattakutti and Sunset Peaks.
                     In the lap of these mountains, a white foaming river called Doodh Ganga curls in thin spirals. This river flows through the picturesque Sang-e-Safed Valley, where in the spring, rare wild Himalayan flowers bloom profusely. The hamlet has made a name for itself as a nice place to hike and picnic.

              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>
                  Except for a few legends, little is known about Yousmarg's history. The derivation of this hamlet's name sheds some light on its history. Yousmarg is a perversion of the Valley's original name, Roosmarg, which means Meadow of Musk deer. In the local language, Roos refers to a deer.
                  Hundreds of years ago, the area was known as Roosmarg, and it was home to a variety of deer and other wildlife. These people used to live in the area until perhaps five or six decades ago. As a result, Yousmarg has remained largely unoccupied, which explains why there are little historical records concerning it.
                  In all of the historical traditions connected to Yousmarg, one thing sticks out: it is the eternal abode of Jesus. Yousmarg, according to Ahmadiyas (a Muslim sect), is a short form of Youza, which means Jesus, and Marg, which means Meadows, hence Yousmarg means "Meadow of Jesus."

                 <p>
                     Yousmarg is a haven for those who prefer the raw beauty of nature to manicured lawns and gardens.
                     Though the journey can be challenging at times, you'll be charmed by the rolling hills, flower-strewn walkways, expansive stretches of meadows crisscrossed by flowing white streams, and brilliant blue lakes that you'll see along the way.
                     As you hike up, the cool breeze across your face will feel nice. The sense of adventure grows as you hike because the pathways are less traveled. It feels as if you're leaving a trail for others to follow when you walk into these uncharted territory.

                 <h3> Do a digital Detox</h3>
                 <p>
                     We sometimes lose touch with our inner selves as a result of cellphones and other technology that allow us to be in touch 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Yousmarg's lack of connectivity is actually a blessing in disguise. You may enjoy the most quiet days of your life with no email notifications, Instagram pop-ups, or SMS alerts.
                     Go offline, disconnect from your subconscious stress, and re-energize with the scent of fresh mountain air, the lyrical sounds of brooks streaming past, the eye-pleasing images of snow-covered hills, and the leafy green colours of the trees. By doing so, not only will you be detoxing from the toxic stress of life, but you will also be immersed in seclusion and quiet.

                 <h3>Go for Rustic Rides</h3>
                 <p>
                     Have you ever fantasized of riding a horse like a king and embarking on an exciting adventure deep into the alpine forests? If that's the case, seize the opportunity to do so in Yousmarg with both hands.
                     Because the main attractions in Yousmarg are located at a high height, they can only be reached by hiking or pony rides. Because the terrain is steep and narrow, many people choose the latter, which makes pony rides a more accessible means of transportation.
                     Horseback riding is also much less expensive than in popular tourist sites such as Pahalgam and Gulmarg. What could be better than a low-cost ride to discover Yousmarg's undiscovered charm?

                 <h3> Chrar-e-Sharief</h3>
                 <p>
                     Chrar-e-Sharief, a shrine dedicated to the Sufi Saint Sheikh Noor-ud-Din Noorani in the village of the same name, lies 33 km away from Srinagar. The temple, which was erected around 600 years ago, is one of Kashmir's oldest shrines, having a rich reservoir of Kashmiri heritage. The shrine's history is marked by beautiful wooden architecture.
                     Sheikh Noor-ud-Din is famous in the valley for his broad promotion of Rishism. As the benefactor saint of Kashmiri Muslims, he is affectionately known as Alamdar-e-Kashmir. Nonviolence, vegetarianism, tolerance, and communal peace were among his teachings. He disseminated his ideas through a number of intellectual books written in poetry, prose, and verse.
                     When he died, legend has it that over 9 lakh worshippers gathered to pay their condolences. Both Muslims and Hindus regard the shrine, which shelters his mortal remains and relics, as having enormous religious value. On the day of his death-anniversary large number of devotees come to pay their respects.

              <h3>Doodh Ganga</h3>
              <p>
                  The Pir Panjal glaciers near the Tatakoti summit give rise to the Doodhganga, a tributary of the Jhelum. Yachera and Sangesafed, two mountain streams, merge to form this river, frothing over boulders, slamming on bedrocks, and rolling over stones, producing a milky white foam, hence the name Doodhganga (Flowing Milk).
                  The glittering stream is only 2 kilometers from Yousmarg, which is easily accessible by trekking. The river is home to a variety of fish species, including Rainbow Trout, and is regarded as one of Kashmir's greatest angling and fishing sites. In addition, the location is an excellent starting point for many trekking adventures, and the visual grandeur of the area surrounding the river makes it an ideal picnic destination.

                 <p>
                     Nilnag Lake is a charming tiny lake about 5 kilometers downhill from Yousmarg. It can only be reached by trekking or pony ride from Gogji Pathri settlement, which is located at an elevation of 2180 meters.
                     Against the emerald-dense pine forests, the river has a vivid blue tint that glows like a gem. The contrast is pleasing to the eye, and the resulting ambience soothes the senses.

              <p>
                  Sang-e-Safed Valley, which means 'White Rocks,' is 10 kilometers from Yousmarg and is named after the frozen lake it protects. It serves as the base camp for trekking to the high Tattakutti peak, which is surrounded by massive mountains. The River Doodh Ganga bisects this fascinating meadow, which is green in the summer and snowy in the winter. The breathtaking scenery of the area makes it ideal for a picnic.

                     Two other meadows, Lidder Mad and Haijan, are at a short distance from the Sang-e-Safed Valley. These lush meadows are one of Kashmir's best-kept secrets, less visited and less well-known, and flanked by hills and pine trees. You'll have to go see for yourself to verify this. The twin meadows, lined by pine trees, guarded by enormous peaks sporting cloud rings, and carpeted by colorful flowers, calm the eyes of all viewers.
