                <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
         If Kashmir is the crowning glory of the Subcontinent, Gulmarg is the colossal gem in that crown, dazzling with changing hues from season to season. In the spring, exotic blossoms of daisies, forget-me-nots, bluebells, and buttercups dazzle with all the vibrant colors of the color pallet. Autumn changes the tinge to warm yellow and brown. Come winter & the gleam is pure, calm, and fleecy white.

        Gulmarg is a magical valley located about 50 kilometers from Srinagar, stretching three kilometers in length and up to a kilometer in width with no condescending boundary walls to break up the gorgeous picture.

        Gulmarg's allure begins even before you arrive, since the road is lined with pine and deodar trees and cuts through the hills. When you set foot on this hill station, you'll be surrounded by tiny lakes, emerald meadows, gushing gardens, enormous snow-capped mountains, bubbling brooks, and interesting slopes.

              <h3>History</h3>
                 
                 <p>  
                    Gulmarg is a combination of the Persian words Gul, which means flowers, and Marg, which means meadows. Thus, it means 'Meadow of Flowers.' Yousuf Shah Chak, the final Chak emperor (who reigned from 1579 to 1586 AD), is credited with discovering this alluring flower meadow.

                    He frequented the vale with his queen, Habba Khatoon, who was enchanted by it. According to P.N Bamzai, a Kashmiri scholar and historian, Chak coined the name Gulmarg for the hamlet, which was previously known as 'Gaurimarg (the fair one)' by the local shepherds in honor of Goddess Parvati or Gauri, a Hindu deity.

                    After Chak's capture by Akbar, Kashmir fell to the Mughals, and Akbar’s son Jahangir made Gulmarg his favored retreat. According to legend, he became so enamored with the flowers he saw at Gulmarg that he went on a collecting frenzy, collecting 21 different varieties of flowers.

   <h3>Drive in the fabled cable car</h3>
        <p>
        Getting onto a Gondola ride is one of the best things to do in Gulmarg. Getting into a Gandola and taking Asia's highest and longest ropeway ride, as well as the world's second-highest and longest ropeway trip, is a must-do activity for all visitors to Gulmarg, whether they are families, romantic couples, or adventurous individuals

It transports over 600 people to and from the Apharwat mountain, a popular winter sports destination in Gulmarg, in two parts. Prepare to be introduced to the chairlift in phase 3, which is primarily used by winter sports expert athletes. People usually limit themselves to the first two phases.

Phase 1 brings travelers from the base station to Kongdoori, a porcelain bowl-shaped location with large fields of snow-covered trees, in roughly 9 minutes.

People are transported from Kongdoori to the shoulder of Apharwat peak, where they acquire an elevation of approximately 2952 feet. Phase 2 takes almost 12 hours to complete.

                 <p>
  Pony rides, akin to the desert ship, are a popular way to get around Gulmarg. Almost a tenth of a million horses strut their stuff down the Gulmarg. Mount one and ride through life's pleasures.

Today, travelers, including family vacationers, honeymoon couples, and especially children, enjoy this pastime since it allows them to feel the air, smell the greenery, see the beauty of nature, and journey through it with their favorite four-legged pet.

                  Participate in the fun of snow rides, snowman construction, and snow fights
              </h3>
              <p>
   Try a variety of fun-filled activities while at Gulmarg by putting your snowshoes ahead. The snow rides are first on the list. The human sled is the most popular of them. You are pulled along the snow-covered roads and gentler slopes after boarding the wooden sled. The ride is so exciting it makes you dizzy.

Tobogganing (runnerless sled) is another ride that involves descending from the top of a hill on a Toboggan (wooden board). Aside from these, the snow scooters and snowmobiles in Gulmarg are a must-try. After a day of skiing on the icy landscape, have some fun with some snowball battles in the open areas. Fight it out until you're delirious with delight, then sit on the white carpet of snow and make a snowman—a frosty companion who will keep the emotion warm in cold weather.

              <h3>Baba Reshi</h3>
              <p>
Nestled in the serene mountains is a 500-year-old shrine of Baba Reshi. As the name suggests, the dedicated shrine is of Baba Payamuddin Reshi, a Muslim scholar, a former minister in the court of Kashmiri King Zain ul Abidin, who renounced worldly life to embrace asceticism. He lived in this particular area of Gulmarg, where his memorial stands today.

Built in 1480, the shrine is a marvel of medieval Kashmiri architecture. The intricate lattice work on windows and carved deodar pillars captivate you, and you can't take your eyes off the craftsmanship of medieval era workers. Thousands of worshipers, regardless of faith or caste, flock to this sanctuary.

Sincere prayers at this shrine are said to grant the wishes of the needy, especially the wish for a child by childless couples. Plastering a daan is one way to make a wish here (a fireplace made of mud). The daan is said to have been fashioned by Baba Reshi himself, therefore this practice dates back to when he was alive.

              Maharani Temple   
              </h3>
              <p>
     A red-roofed temple named Maharani temple was built on a small hillock amidst luxuriant herbage by Maharani Mohini Bai Sisodia, queen of the last ruler of Jammu and Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh.

The temple, also known as Mohineshwar Shivalaya, is dedicated to the couple and features a Shiv Lingam and a statue of goddess Parvati. The crimson temple roof against the emerald field creates a stunning contrast, making the temple visible from all sides of town.

The temple has also been in a number of Bollywood films in the past. However, the most notable feature of this Hindu temple is the presence of a Muslim priest. After Kashmiri Pandits departed the valley in the 1990s, Ghulam Mohammad Sheikh, a Kashmiri Muslim, stepped into the shoes of a Muslim pujari when no one else could.

The menu includes a welcome hot drink like kehwa, chicken and mutton tikka appetizers, and formal vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals.
